## Hola, I am IIiana:

What a joy that you are here! I’d like to share with you my Why, I want individuals to experience the how to Influence consciously their reality to stop feeling trapped in some aspect of life as I was. My other core driver is to love and feel loved!

Professionally I am a Manifestation Coach. 10 years ago I finally “became” via the quantum principles that I am teaching, the person that cultivates the internal skills to consciously influence and manipulate my reality. I am an evidence of the implementation of these principles, I breathe them, walk them and are passionate to train you!

I started the journey of personal exploration 20 years ago, looking for something to help me understand my early life experiences and it became my service to the world for the last 15 years.
I had a period of my life where I reached a personal breaking point, feeling uninspired and with no route. I was worried about not doing enough, afraid of the future and uncomfortable with the uncertainty.

The apparently dark episode was a hidden gift that led me to the Quantum Manifestation world, I committed to interiorize these principles to transform internally and externally and align to my deepest truth in such an effective way that I dedicated my Coaching practice to these Quantum Manifestation phenomenal and beautiful teachings.

My daily purpose is to help more clients, like you, to become Conscious Creators of the Reality that brings them security and trust about their future!

> I am deeply fulfilled as a mom of two amazing boys and my heart is filled with love from within and from people around me, currently I live in Canada, Vancouver Island and work online internationally facilitating Master your Reality Mastermind groups.
